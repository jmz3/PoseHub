# PoseHub
PoseHub is a library that manages the transformations of different sensors and objects in the same scene and provides a unified interface for accessing them.

## Data Structure
Currently, the basic data structure is a customized graph class called `PoseGraph`. It is a directed graph that stores the transformation between nodes. The transformation is represented by a `Pose` class, which contains a 3x3 rotation matrix and a 3x1 translation vector. The `PoseGraph` class provides a unified interface for accessing the transformation between any two nodes. The transformation between two nodes is the product of all the transformations along the path between them. The `PoseGraph` class also provides a unified interface for accessing the transformation between any node and the root node. The transformation between a node and the root node is the product of all the transformations along the path from the node to the root node.
